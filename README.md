## Project Information

This project was developed by our organization to collect and analyze tweets from countries across the Arab region, focusing on discussions related to the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.  
Rather than scraping only tweets that explicitly mention the SDGs, the project identifies tweets related to **topics aligned with individual goals**, providing a more comprehensive view of regional engagement.

The workflow includes:
- **Data Collection** – Scraping tweets by country, date, and relevant keywords  
- **Sentiment Analysis** – Determining whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral toward each SDG topic  
- **Word Cloud Analysis** – Highlighting the most frequent words and themes in SDG-related discussions  

The results provide insights at both the **country** and **regional** levels, helping understand public perception and discourse around sustainable development in the Arab region.

## Important Note

This project was originally developed in **2022**, during a period when **Twitter (now X)** offered scraping APIs that allowed cost-effective access to public tweets.  
As of **February 2023**, Twitter discontinued or significantly restricted access to these APIs. The scraping functionality used in this project may therefore no longer be operational under the current API policies.
